My goal while making this game is to write cleaner code.The game consists of four parts. 
With the onion design, the game shows what phases it should consist of. 
First, our rocket needs to fly. 
Secondly, a collision check is performed. 
Let's make the level progression system

In the game, when you hit the wall or the ground, you die and continue from the part you left off.
There are multiple sounds and particle systems in the game.
